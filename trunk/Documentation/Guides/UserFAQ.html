  <dt>Does PDFKeeper work on other Oracle databases?</dt>
    <dd>Only Oracle Database Express Edition is supported. However, if you are
      a developer, experienced with both Oracle Database and VB.NET, you should
      be able to get it to function with some modification on any edition of
      Oracle Database 10g or later with Oracle Text enabled.</dd>
  <dt>Will other databases be supported in the future?</dt>
    <dd>It would be ideal to expand the scope of PDFKeeper to work with other
      editions of the Oracle Database and Oracle Database Cloud. However, this
      will be dictated by need, time permiting.</dd>
  <dt>Will PDFKeeper function on 64-bit versions of Windows?</dt>
    <dd>PDFKeeper is a 32-bit application that should function on 64-bit
      Windows. However, it has not been tested on a 64-bit version of the
      Windows operating system.</dd>
